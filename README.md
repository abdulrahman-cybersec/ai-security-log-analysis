# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Project Overview
This project presents an educational and practical AI-based cybersecurity system designed to detect abnormal network behavior and potential security threats.

The system focuses on defensive cybersecurity and applies machine learning techniques to analyze simulated network traffic and security logs in a safe, offline environment.

## Objectives
- Detect abnormal network behavior using machine learning techniques  
- Analyze simulated network traffic and security logs  
- Reduce false positives compared to traditional rule-based systems  
- Provide an educational cybersecurity model suitable for academic use  

## Methodology
Publicly available and ethically sourced datasets were used to simulate network traffic.
No real user data or live systems were involved.

The data was cleaned, normalized, and labeled before applying machine learning models such as:
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Detection accuracy  
- False positive rate  
- System responsiveness  

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python  
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- Data Visualization: Grafana, Power BI  
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu)
